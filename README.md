Blockchain Assignments – Summary
## Tools & Technologies Used

Solidity – for writing smart contracts.

Remix, Hardhat, Truffle – smart contract development environments.

Ethereum Testnets – Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon (Mumbai) for deployment.

MetaMask – wallet for interacting with contracts and managing test ETH.

Etherscan / Block Explorers – for verifying and tracking transactions.

IPFS / Decentralized Storage – for storing NFT metadata.

React / Next.js / Vue.js – for building Web3 frontends.

Hyperledger Fabric + Docker – for private blockchain networks.
## What We Learn

Smart Contract Development & Deployment

How to write, compile, and deploy contracts on Ethereum testnets.

Using MetaMask and faucets for transactions.

ERC-20 Token Creation

Understanding token standards.

Implementing supply, mint, burn, and transfer functions.

Exploring tokenomics and verifying contracts.

Decentralized Voting System

Designing blockchain-based voting.

Registering voters, casting votes securely, and real-time result viewing.

Learning about security in decentralized apps.

NFT Marketplace Development

Building ERC-721 contracts for minting NFTs.

Using IPFS for NFT storage.

Developing Web3-based marketplaces with frontend frameworks.

Private Blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric

Setting up a permissioned blockchain using Docker Compose.

Writing & deploying chaincode (Fabric smart contracts).

Testing network with CLI/SDK.
## Bonus Challenges

Hyperledger + IoT Integration – IoT sensors recording blockchain data.

Smart Contract Security Audit – analyzing vulnerabilities and proposing fixes.

Cross-Chain Token Bridge – connecting Ethereum and Polygon for token transfer.
## This assignment set helps us understand the full lifecycle of decentralized applications (DApps):

From writing contracts → deploying on testnets → building real-world use cases like tokens, NFTs, and voting.

It also introduces enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger) and advanced concepts like cross-chain and security audits.
